## About The Project

![nibblehood_screenshot_with_color](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/5004bab0-6406-4584-a805-f7abcb03ff96)

Nibblehood is a community-driven application designed to help people living in close-knit neighborhoods build stronger connections. Whether giving food, sharing recipes, or lending a hand to a neighbor, Nibblehood makes it easy to engage with your local community in meaningful ways.

#### Features

* Local Food Sharing: Share food with your neighbors and discover home-cooked meals.
* Location-based: All features are localized, ensuring that your interactions are with those in your immediate vicinity.
* Gamification: With each interaction earning points, you can compete against other neighborhoods to see who can be the most connected community!

#### Vision

In todayâ€™s fast-paced world, it's easy to lose touch with the people living next door. Nibblehood strives to make neighborhoods feel like home again by creating opportunities for neighbors to interact, share, and grow together. By fostering trust and goodwill, the app aims to make local communities closer and more connected.

#### How we built it

We started with some mockups on Figma, fleshing out our idea as we thought of data and class structures. Once we had an idea of our software structure, we began a Next.js project. We implemented our idea with React and chakra-ui as tools to power our front-end, and Node.js and Firebase (Firestore, Firebase Authentication, Firebase Storage) to work the back-end.

#### Challenges we ran into

One of the more prominent challenges we encountered was creating the front-end design from the Figma file. As a result, our working web app does not have all of the features and designs of our Figma design. This was a bit of a letdown, as the look of our web app did not match our expectations.

#### What we learned

This was one of our team's first hackathons, and we were really proud of the product we produced. With one designer in our group, it was a good learning experience in terms of the designer-developer dynamics for all of us. Throughout the whole hackathon process, we learned more about database acquisition, design to front-end transformation, and handling REST API calls.
